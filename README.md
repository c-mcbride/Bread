# Bread Java Project

This is a simple Java project named "Bread". It starts as a console application and will later integrate JavaFX for a graphical user interface. The goal is to create a budget application
useful for budgeting decisions moment to moment. This will be presented with a clean ui and darkmode, hopefully with a dracula like theme. 

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bread.git

2. Make sure you have JDK 11 or later installed.
3. Open the project in VS Code and run it using the "Run" button.

## Usage
